# sh

 SH - SSH but without the secure part  
 or  
 SH - Secure Hell  

Tell me which one you think would fit this better

## Usage

```syntax
sh [connect|serve] <ip> <port>
```

## Security

Not perfect, but does ask for password and issues 5 challenges to check the password without exposing it or a hash of it  

100% can be bruteforced....
